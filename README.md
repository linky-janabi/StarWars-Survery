# ⭐ Star Wars Survey Data Analysis  
Uncovering Fan Favorites, One Response at a Time

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores a survey conducted by FiveThirtyEight to settle one major debate: *Is The Empire Strikes Back really the best Star Wars movie?* Using Python and pandas, I cleaned and analyzed responses from 835 participants to reveal audience preferences based on demographics, fanship, and education level.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Clean messy survey data (yes, someone really answered “Maybe” to being a fan).
- Analyze audience rankings of all six Star Wars episodes.
- Segment trends by gender, education, and whether they consider themselves fans.
- Confirm (or challenge) the myth of Episode V’s dominance.

## 🧠 Key Learnings  
- Wrangled complex survey responses into usable insights.  
- Practiced data segmentation and visualization techniques.  
- Learned the power of humor, curiosity, and pandas `.value_counts()`.

## 📊 Fun Fact  
72% of respondents agreed: *The Empire Strikes Back* reigns supreme—proving that some fandom debates *can* be settled with data.

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Survey data from [FiveThirtyEight’s GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)
